The R package `echartr` provides an interface to the [Echarts](https://echarts.apache.org) JavaScript library for creating interactive charts. 

`echartr` aims to match the Echarts Javascript API as closely as possible so that you can refer directly to the [official Echarts documentation](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html).

This package is intended for more advanced users with Echarts familiarity. It is not intended to be a replacement for the popular [`echarts4r`](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/) package, which is more user-friendly and provides a higher-level interface to Echarts.

## Basic example

The [option argument](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html) is provided as a list of lists:

```r
library(echartr)

echartr(option = list(
  xAxis = list(type = "category", data = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")),
  yAxis = list(type = "value"),
  series = list(
    list(
      name = "Example",
      type = "line",
      data = c(150, 230, 224, 218, 135, 147, 260),
      smooth = TRUE
    )
  )
))
```

## Working with data frames

`echartr` provides helper functions for building Echart [series](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#series) from data frames

```r
library(datasets)
library(echartr)

echartr(option = list(
  xAxis = list(type = "value"),
  yAxis = list(type = "value"),
  legend = list(show = TRUE),
  series = ec_scatter(iris,
                      
    # Data dimensions and series attributes are provided as expressions that can 
    # be evaluated for each row to build multiple series
    Petal.Length, # x
    Petal.Width, # y
    
    name = as.character(Species),
    symbol = if (Species == "versicolor") "circle" else "emptyCircle",
    itemStyle = list(
      opacity = if (Species == "setosa") 0.5 else 1
    )
  )
))

```
