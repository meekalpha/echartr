The goal of echartr is to provide an R interface to Apache Echarts that matches the Javascript API as closely as possible.

echartr makes it easier to use the more advanced features of Echarts, since you can refer to the official Apache Echarts documentation (https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html)


## Installation
